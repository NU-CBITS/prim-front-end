  <h3>What is the reason for doing this study?</h3>
  <p>The purpose of this study is to understand more about recent HIV infection among men in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS).  Persons who have recent HIV may have differences in the HIV virus and the bodies immune response to HIV as compared to persons who have had HIV for more than one year.  They may also have different responses to HIV medications.  We hope to look at your HIV virus and see how similar or different the virus is to persons with long standing HIV and other persons with recent HIV.  We hope to look at your bodyâ€™s immune responses to HIV. You are being asked to see if you can participate in the study because your doctor feels you have contracted HIV within the past year.</p>

  <h3>What you will do if you choose to be in this study?</h3>
  <p>In order to determine whether you are eligible for the study, we will initially ask you to complete a brief series of questions about your health and HIV status. These will include questions about when you think you might have contracted HIV. The questions will take about five minutes.</p>
  <p>As part of the eligibility process, we ask your permission for a study personnel to contact you to arrange a time to meet at our clinic at Northwestern Hospital. If you are determined to be eligible, a study personnel will contact you via the method that selected.  They will arrange for you to come to our clinic.  There you will learn more about the MACS study and recent HIV substudy and can decide then whether you want to participate.</p>

  <h3>What are some of the risks and discomforts that may happen to people who are in this study?</h3>
  <p>The risks from completing the self-report measures and interviews are minimal, but it is possible that you may experience emotional discomfort or increased anxiety as a result of answering questions about your HIV infection, especially if this is a new diagnosis for you.  You have the option of stopping at any time</p>
