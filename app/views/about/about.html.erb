    <h1>The MACS at Thirty Years</h1>
    <p>In the fall of 1983, a group of investigators met at the National Institutes of Health  (NIH ) to design a prospective epidemiologic study of the newly recognized immunodeficiency syndrome  in men who had sex with men (MSM) in Los Angeles, San Francisco and New York. Upon completion of designing the protocol, recruitment of MSM began in April of 1984 into the investigation which was named The Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study or MACS. The first wave of participant recruitment was completed by March 31, 1985. Since then three  more periods of enrollment have been opened; the first in 1987 to increase the participation of African-American (AA) MSM in the study and the second in 2001 to again increase participation by AA and Hispanic MSM.  Currently, recruitment of MSM, with recent HIV infection, to replace recent losses caused by death and dropouts has been initiated. As of October 2013, 7087 men have volunteered and participated in the MACS. The currently active participants number 2340; 35 % are non white and half of all participants are older than 55 years of age.  In Chicago 1387 men have enrolled into the study.</p>
    <p>The initial recruitment in 1984-85 was carried out before we had a laboratory test to determine who was a risk of developing AIDS.  HIV had been suggested as the cause of the immunodeficiency in 1983 by investigators at the Pasteur Institute in Paris but this was not  confirmed until the spring of 1984ot by investigators in San Francisco and the NIH in the spring of 1984. However, a blood test to determine who was infected did not become available until the spring of 1985. When the original group of MSM who had joined the MACS underwent  testing it was discovered that approximately 40 percent of the cohort was infected.</p>
    <p>This allowed the MACS to address two important issues. First, we could determine the behaviors, clinical findings and laboratory results which were associated with progression from HIV infection to AIDS. Secondly among the uninfected men, the behaviors that led to HIV infection and the early signs and symptoms of this viral infection could be elucidated. To date 712 uninfected men at entry into the MACS acquired HIV infection during the study, 333 developed AIDS and 82.9% of these men have died.</p>
    <p>Early in the course of the study it became apparent that dementia was a major problem for men who developed advanced HIV infection and AIDS. MACS investigators organized a working group of neurologists to investigate this problem. The most important early finding was that severe central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) problems were seen only in persons with AIDS and that there was no reason for HIV infected men without AIDS to be restricted in their work. This finding became the basis of World Health Organization recommendation which was widely accepted advising that persons with HIV infection need not be restricted in their activities.</p>
    <p>During the period of the 1980s the death rate among the infected MACS participants was very high. As of the fall of 2013, close to 90 percent of men who entered the MACS with HIV infection have died. The MACS investigators were among the first to demonstrated that the T-Helper cell count below 200/mm3 were associated with a high rate of  pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) and helper cell counts below 100/mm3 put individuals at risk for cytomegalovirus  retinitis, atypical mycobacterial infections, and infection of the brain with the parasite Toxoplasma gondii. Giving antibiotics to prevent some of these opportunistic infections helped but the early agents available to treat the HIV infection did not prevent progression to AIDS or death.</p>
    <p>An early observation of MACS investigators was that the progression of newly acquired HIV infections to AIDS differed from individual to individual. Determinants of this heterogeneity included age at the time of infection and host genetics. The genetic makeup of an individual determines their immune response to HIV which in turn controls the rate of viral replication. Lower levels of replication result in slower progression of untreated HIV infection. Host genetics also determines susceptibility to HIV infection. The MACS contributed to the discovery of an uncommon mutation which protects people with this mutation from the usual form of HIV which is transmitted sexually.</p>
    <p>With the availability of effective antiretroviral therapy in late 1995 progression to AIDS and death decreased dramatically in men on therapy. Close to 80% of participants in the MACS taking drugs have suppressed HIV replication and the median T-helper cell count is near 600/mm3. Stopping drug treatment results in progression of HIV infection and disease. With this greatly improved survival of infected participants the MACS has focused upon the health status of men who were living longer. To accomplish this investigators have been recruited into working groups with interest in diseases of the heart, lungs, kidneys, liver and metabolic diseases such as diabetes. The behavioral working group has continued to study behaviors to determine why men fail to adhere to treatment. Recreational drugs and alcohol use have been shown to be associated with poor adherence. Drug use also is associated with a marked increase in the risk of acquiring HIV infection. The neurology working group continues to investigate brain function among aging HIV infected men and the Aging working group is attempting  to determine whether or not HIV infected men age more rapidly than ininfected men. Here are several short summaries of the findings of some of these investigations.</p>

    <h3>Liver Disease</h3>
    <p>Liver disease in persons with HIV infection has been recognized as an increasing cause of non AIDS related illness. In the MACS, HIV infection greatly increases liver-related deaths from chronic Hepatitis B.  The role of the immune response to the hepatitis B virus (HBV) is important in recovery from HBV infection as investigation in the MACS has demonstrated.  Recovery from HBV infection is the rule (90% of acute infections lead to immune control of the infection with 10% leading to chronic hepatitis B. In the MACS, we showed that the combination of tenofovir with emtricitabine or lamivudine is the best long-term treatment for those with chronic hepatitis B. HBV infection, which is transmitted sexually and by sharing contaminated needles, can be prevented by a vaccine.</p>
    <p>A second virus which causes liver disease is Hepatitis C (HCV). HCV can be transmitted sexually, and there are a number of reports of mini epidemics in MSM due to sexual transmission.  HCV is more commonly transmitted by sharing contaminated needles. In the MACS more than 400 men have been identified who came into the study with HCV infection. In addition 115 men developed HCV infection during follow up. New or incident HCV infections have occurred among MACS participants from 1984 on. Factors associated with acquiring HCV include HIV infection, older age, chronic Hepatitis B infection, syphilis and unprotected receptive anal intercourse. Some infected persons clear HCV but not as commonly as HBV infection. Clearance of HCV is associated with a specific genetic makeup of the infected individual and persistence of HCV is associated with HIV infection. Chronic HCV infection can lead to severe liver disease and cancer of the liver. Unfortunately there is no vaccine which can protect an individual from HCV infection. However there is treatment, which is difficult to take and effective in only some people, but  newer agents are becoming available that will simplify and improve treatment of this liver infection.</p>

    <h3>Malignant Disease</h3>
    <p>Effective antiretroviral therapy has greatly reduced the occurrence of Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS) and Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) in HIV infected men in the MACS. However, both of these malignant diseases  still occur more frequently in HIV infected than in uninfected MSM. Non-AIDS –defining cancers, particularly anal cancer and Hodgkin lymphoma are seen more commonly in infected as compared to uninfected men.</p>
    <p>Immunosuppression resulting from HIV infection was recognized early in the epidemic. However, the infection also activates a component of the immune system abnormally. This activation of the B-cells, which produce antibodies, has been documented by MACS investigators to predate the development of NHL by three or more years. This working group has also studied the relationship between serum proteins and development of KS and the immune response to the  Human Herpes Virus 8 (HHV8) which causes KS. It is still not clear how HHV8 infection causes KS 20 years after the discovery of the relationship of this virus to KS.</p>
    <p>Given the increase in anal cancer the MACS has evaluated the attitudes about  of anal PAP (cytology) screening.  Participants, both HIV infected and uninfected have moderate –high interest in such screening. Therefore we instituted screening for abnormal cytology and presence of the human papilloma virus (HPV). Certain strains of HPV cause anal cancer and cervical cancer in women and are termed oncogenic.. HIV infected men have been infected with more oncogenic  strains of HPV than the uninfected men. The higher prevalence of HPV was associated with number of sexual partners and lower CD4 T-cell counts. HPV also causes cancer of the throat. Therefore, the MACS initiated a study of oral HPV to determine the effects of HIV infection and immunosuppression treatment.  Strategies to more quickly indentify recently infected persons such as understanding the relatedness of recent infections in this area could help target and interrupt HIV transmission.</p>

    <h3>Cardiovascular Disease</h3>
    <p>The MACS Cardiovascular Study has evaluated approximately 1000 HIV-infected and uninfected men to date who have undergone CT scans of the coronary arteries (blood vessels that supply the heart muscle). Comparisons of CT scan findings between HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected men have revealed that important differences in the amount and type of  coronary artery plaque (blockages) exist and that  these may  have important implications for the overall cardiovascular health of HIV-infected  and uninfected men.  Several analyses and medical research reports based upon these findings are being prepared and have been reported at national and international meetings for HIV research. These findings may ultimately be able to provide important insights to treating clinicians who seek to improve prevention, detection, and treatment of heart disease among MSM who HIV-infected and uninfected.</p>

    <h3>Kidney Disease</h3>
    <p>The MACS Renal Study has evaluated the kidney function of approximately 800 HIV-infected and uninfected men using a state-of-the-art technique that involves injection of a harmless substance called iohexol into the vein of an individual and then measuring its dilution and disappearance from blood over the ensuing four hours; these measurements provide extremely precise estimates of an individual’s kidney function.  The first round of these measurements, completed 2 years ago, revealed that, despite the fact that the overall kidney health of MACS participants is superb, there are important subtle differences in kidney function when comparing HIV-infected and uninfected men.   We are now in the process of completing the 2nd round of these measurements; this  will allow us to make comparisons of kidney function over time and will help us to determine whether the normal changes in renal function that are expected with advancing age and the factors that contribute to these changes are different for HIV-infected persons.</p>

    <h2>Studies of Host Genetics</h2>
    <p>Over the last few decades, genetic research has become increasingly important in understanding infectious diseases and in improving the health of those chronically infected with HIV-1.  The MACS has played a major role in advancing the field of genetics with the gracious support of the participants and the large sample repository. The Chicago MACS was instrumental in finding the CCR5 32-bp deletion that in some individuals prevents HIV-1 infections.  This led directly to creation of a novel medication, which mimics the function of the deletion and helps HIV-1 disease treatment.  We have since continued to explore the interaction between HIV-1 infection and our genes, both to explain how certain individuals are resistant to infection and how certain individuals control the virus after infection.  We have sought to genetically define the ancestry of the MACS participants, screen for genetic variants that have been associated with different rates of HIV-1 infection and progression and are now exploring deeper areas of these genes and others related to immunity.  We hope that our efforts will lead to new medications for treatment and ultimately define what is necessary for a cure and improve prevention.</p>


    <h3>Recruitment of men with acute and recent HIV infection.</h3>
    <p>In the US about 50,000 persons become newly infected with HIV each year.  Twenty percent of all infected persons are unaware of their HIV infection and about one third of persons present with clinical AIDS at the time of their diagnosis indicating late presentation.  Recent data has demonstrated a potential benefit to persons starting ART therapy very early in their illness-even before seroconversion (detection of antibody).  Reported benefits include better virologic control and potentially smaller reservoirs of HIV and enhanced CD4 cell count recovery.</p>
    <p>In addition, we now have evidence that HIV treatment of infected persons is an important part of HIV prevention due to the marked reduction of transmission when an HIV infected person is on virally suppressive antiretroviral therapy (ART).  Given the high levels of HIV virus in the blood and semen of recently infected persons, these persons are a disproportionate contribution to HIV transmission and as such may be a very high impact population to start treatment.  Strategies to more quickly indentify recently infected persons such as understanding the relatedness of recent infections in this area could help target and interrupt HIV transmission.</p>
    <p>For these reasons, the MACS will soon be recruiting men with acute or recent HIV infection.  Acutely infected men are those with a positive HIV antigen/antibody test with a negative or indeterminate Western blot but a positive HIV RNA PCR in the blood.  Recently infected men are who have a positive HIV Ag/ab combo or HIV antibody test and confirmed HIV by Western blot will be considered recent infection and also be eligible. In addition to enrollment in the study, subjects will be referred for clinical care outside of the study, which will include the recommendation of ART therapy as soon as feasible. Subjects will be followed over one year for this sub-study, they will continue follow up in the MACS study following the completion of the sub-study.</p>


    <h3>Why MACS Really, Really Appreciates the Contribution of HIV negative Men</h3>
    <p>The Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study is the longest running study of HIV infection and disease among MSM with and without HIV infection.  We often are asked “but if this is a study of HIV, why do you want men without HIV to participate?”  It’s a fair question.  If we want to study the virus and how the virus causes disease we should look at people who actually have the virus.  But that only works if we know exactly what we are looking for and how it relates to the virus.  And often we don’t know that.</p>
    <p>The MACS is an incredibly unique study because of the HIV negative men who participate.  MSM are not the same as all other men; they may be more fit than other men, they may drink more, they  may have more stress or mental health issues related to stigma or they  may see  doctors more for preventative care.  While there are other studies that study MSM with HIV, there are no other studies that can compare HIV negative MSM with HIV infected MSM.   By completing the same tests as the HIV positive men, HIV negative men allow us to make the right comparisons.   HIV negative MSM are not infected and changes to their health may be more gradual and due to age, diseases of aging or other infections.  Any man’s health can improve or worsen for all sorts of reasons.</p>
    <p>Following the uninfected men will enable the MACS investigators to know that a change we see in men with HIV is due to their infection.  If we can’t compare the health of men with HIV to similar men without HIV we have no way of knowing.</p>
    <p>In the last decade we have come a long way in treating HIV.  Now we have men aging with the virus and a whole host of diseases that we never thought we would have to face are being seen.  Cancer, heart disease, mental decline – all of these may be more common in HIV infection, or maybe not.  For instance, MACS studies have shown that some changes in brain function are due to aging, NOT HIV.  If we hadn’t been able to compare brain scans from HIV positive and HIV negative men – we would never have known it was aging and not HIV.   MACS continue to study health outcomes of particular interest to the MSM community.  Having the right comparison group is vital to our ability to correctly link health outcomes with a probable cause.  Without the important contribution of the HIV negative men, we would never be able to conduct the life saving research we have done so far.</p>
    <p>So, Thank You!   Your contribution to the MACS has advanced our knowledge of HIV and led to important advances in health care for infected men.</p>
