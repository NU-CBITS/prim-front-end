  body: "<strong>About the study:</strong>\n<br><br>\nThe research team at Northwestern
    University’s Center for Behavioral Intervention Technologies (CBITs) is currently
    working on Stepped Care, a five-year research project funded by a grant from
    the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH).\n<br><br>\nThe researchers are
    currently looking for participants for this study, which uses technology to
    help make treatments for depression more affordable and easier for people to
    access. Participants in this study will receive therapy for depression either
    by telephone with a therapist, or through a website with weekly consultations
    from a therapist.  As all therapy sessions will take place over the telephone
    or online, visiting the research center will not be necessary.    \n<br><br>\n<strong>Types
    of therapy:</strong>\n<br><br>\nEligible and interested participants will be
    randomly assigned to receive one of two interventions:\n<br><br>\n1)     Telephone
    Administered Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (T-CBT): A weekly, 50-minute therapy
    session over the phone with a licensed clinician; or\n<br><br>\n2)     Stepped
    Care: Internet Administered Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (iCBT), with regular
    10 minute phone calls from a licensed clinician + the opportunity to receive
    telephone administered-CBT if indicated by the clinician.  \n<br><br>\nTreatment
    lasts for a maximum of 20 weeks in all interventions.  If depression symptoms
    improve, treatment may be ended earlier than 20 weeks.  \n<br><br>\nAs a participant
    in this study, you may experience improvements in your mood and/ or quality
    of life.  Your participation will also help researchers get a better understanding
    of different treatment methods for depression.  And in addition to receiving
    therapy free of charge, study participants will be compensated for completing
    telephone interviews and questionnaires online.\n<br><br>\nIf you have regular
    access to internet connectivity and a phone that can support weekly telephone
    therapy sessions for up to 50 minutes in length, we encourage you to complete
    the form (at the bottom of the page), and you will be contacted by our research
    staff shortly."

    In order to determine eligibility, all interested participants will be asked to complete preliminary interviews and online questionnaires regarding their recent mood and technology use. <br><br>
    We are recruiting individuals who are currently experiencing clinical symptoms of depression. Having a diagnosis of depression from a doctor is not necessary for participation. All participants in this study <strong> must be at least 18 years of age</strong>, and <strong>have proficient experience and understanding of using the internet</strong>. <br><br>
    At this time, our clinicians can only offer treatment to English-speaking individuals and those who can read, hear and see well enough to complete the interviews and questionnaires associated with this study.  If you are currently receiving therapy from another source, this study may not be a good fit for you. Lastly, we are studying experimental treatments for depression-- if you’re experiencing symptoms related to other mental health disorders, this study may not be a good fit. <br><br>
